# Random Quote Machine

This is a Random Quote Machine based in a practice from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine) where I consumed the [Forismatic API](http://forismatic.com/en/api/) using AJAX.

This are the user stories:

* User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
* User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

You can see it on action in my [codepen profile](http://codepen.io/robertlluberes/full/EKOZRP/)
